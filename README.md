# umbraco-realestate-demo

This is a repo for an at-home task, to get introduced to the Umbraco CMS.

**Expected outcome**
- Website is built using Umbraco 7 or 8  (not 9)
- A nice looking website running locally (no server setup)
  - Do not use you time on building the  frontend from scratch, use a free template like [this one](https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page253/estateagency) or some framework like [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- User can setup home and about page content in Umbraco backend.
- User manages listings in Umbraco backend
- Listings have properties that are used for filtering (Area, size, price, etc..)
- Listings have headline, description, images, etc..

**Bonus points**
- Free text search using built-in search function in Umbraco (using Examine)
- Async search and filter (using JavaScript to fetch content in the listing page without refresh)
- Home and about page are built using Umbraco grid
- Listing has multiple image that are rendered in a swiper on the website
- Nice and tidy project structure
- Proper Git repo setup (Git ignore, etc.)
- Project runs without any issue when cloned on other machines

**Notes**
A great resource to learn Umbraco v8 is [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL90L_HquhD-_N2mO8kYzhZL15sh1lyxVK)
